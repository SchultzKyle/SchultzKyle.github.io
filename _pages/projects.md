Below are some of the projects I have worked on. My published work can also be tracked on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5dPjODwAAAAJ).

I have built robots from the ground up, including design and actuator/sensor integration to simulation and motion planning. I have also deployed off-the-shelf robots including the <a href="https://www.universal-robots.com/products/ur10-robot/">UR10e</a> and the <a href="https://www.hdtrobotics.com/">HDT Adroit</a> in custom applications.

<li> <strong>Tendon Sheath Robot Design</strong> <br> 
  With collaborators at the BARC, we designed and built a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220281102A1/">patent pending</a> confined space robot from the ground up.

<li> <strong>ROS EtherCAT Servo Control</strong> <br> 
  I built a <a href="https://github.com/SchultzKyle/yaskawa-ros-ethercat-control">ROS EtherCAT master</a> to control Yaskawa servo drives. This enables custom robots built with Yaskawa servos to be easily controlled from ROS.

<li> <strong>Camera Based State Estimation</strong> <br> 
 Volatile fumes in confined spaces preclude many electronics such as encoders, making certified cameras suitable for state estimation. At the BARC, we created a camera based state estimation system using AprilTags, allowing for the creation of a digital twin to improve control and operator awareness.

<li> <strong>Collaborative Robot Lift Assist</strong> <br> 
  At the BARC, I helped to build a robotic lift assist for aerospace manufacturing. We designed a mobile base for a collaborative robot, and using force/torque measurements a mechanic can effortlessly move a variety of heavy tools - reducing strain and injuries.

<li> <strong>Precision Control of Tendon-Sheath Robots</strong> <br> 
  Tendon-sheath robots suffer from backlash hysteresis, making precision control challenging. Along with Wade Marquette, I developed a control strategy that achieves an order of magnitude higher precision over existing methods (publication in process).

<li> <strong>Robotic Eyes</strong> <br> 
  For my undergraduate mechatronics captsone, we created a set of "robotic eyes" that could mimic human head and eye movement. This project was in partnership with Microsoft to create a repeatable system for testing computer eye trackers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C0g8liDMJ8&t=52s">Here's a video of the system.</a>
