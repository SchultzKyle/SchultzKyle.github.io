<p style="text-align: justify">
I am a PhD student in both the [Boeing Advanced Research Center (BARC)](https://depts.washington.edu/barc/node/1), and the [Precision Controls Lab (UPC)](http://faculty.washington.edu/devasia/) at the University of Washington Deparment of Mechanical Engineering. At the BARC lab, I design robots for confined space manufacturing and collaborative robots that assist mechanics on the factory floor. At the UPC lab, I'm developing algorithms for human intent inference and shared control.

### My research interests are:
- Human intent inference for shared control
- Human-robot collaborative object transportation
- Applications of robotics in manufacturing
